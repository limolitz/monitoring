# Quantified Self Scripts

Or: I'm learning python.

Each folder consists of a script which logs its data to a database, a script to create the database and a script to plot the results.

Currently working scripts:
* Logging of currently opened tabs in Firefox
* Logging of traffic

Not yet working:
* Logging of visited sites and duration in Firefox
* Counting sent and reveived mails over IMAP
