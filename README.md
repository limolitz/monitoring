# Quantified Self Scripts

Or: I'm learning python.

My Quantified Self scripts. Currently mainly focused on collecting data of my computer.

Each folder consists of a script which logs its data to a database, a script to create the database and a script to plot the results.

Currently working scripts:
* Logging of currently opened tabs in Firefox (Linux only)
* Logging of traffic (Linux only)
* Logging of eMail traffic over IMAP

Not yet working:
* Logging of visited sites and duration in Firefox
